The framework/library/CMS I chose for this problem was pages.github.com as recommended by a TA.
I followed the steps outlined [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) and made a webpage with basically no hassle.
I encountered basically no problems when creating this webpage.  The closest thing that could be considered an obstacle was just navigating GitHub's menus as I don't use GitHub very often.
